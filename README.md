Ractive bindings for PureScript (Work in progress)

Based on the original sources from <a href="https://github.com/AitorATuin/purescript-ractive" target="_blank">AitorATui</a>

This version is compatible with **psc 0.8.0.0**.

The original Grunt mechanics were replaced by Gulp.

For quick testing a small demo app is available.

## Future planning

To map the <a href="http://docs.ractivejs.org/latest/get-started" target="_blank">Ractive APIs</a> (Event Handling, Parallel DOM, Proxy Events etc.)

## Building the Bindings

```
npm install (initial build only)
bower update (initial build only)
gulp
```

## Building the Demo

```
gulp build-demo
open index.html from subdir demo
```

## Bugs / Issues etc.

There's a <a href="https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/1767" target="_blank">bug</a> in the current PureScript release that leads to generation of invalid identifiers (e.g *f π* or *w'*).

This <a href="https://github.com/purescript/purescript/pull/1737" target="_blank">will be fixed</a> in the next RC/release and until then I'm shipping the autogenerated & cleaned JS files in the **output** directory.
